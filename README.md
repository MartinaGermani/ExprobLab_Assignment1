### 1. Brief introduction to the project
In this repository, you can find a software architecture for planning and controlling the robot's behavior in a indoor environment for surveillance purposes.

The goal of the robot is to move between different locations in order to visit them and stay there for some times; in particular, the robot has to mainly stay in the corridors and move in a room if it becomes urgent because it has not been visited for some times. Moreover, when its battery is low, it has to move in the recharging station in order to recharge.
